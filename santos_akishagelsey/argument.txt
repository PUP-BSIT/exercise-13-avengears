Both DIT 2-1 and BSIT 3-1 conducted a face to face class instead of online class. I support having face to face classes than onlince classes because it can offer several advantages over online classes, primarily due to the interpersonal interaction and immersive learning experiences they provide. Here are some key reasons why face-to-face classes are important: 

- Hands-On Learning: Some subjects, such as science experiments, art projects, or hands-on technical skills, are best taught in a face-to-face setting where students have access to physical materials and equipment. This hands-on experience is crucial for reinforcing theoretical concepts and developing practical skills.

- Enhanced Focus and Engagement: Being physically present in a classroom environment can help students stay focused and engaged in the learning process. The structured environment of a classroom can reduce distractions and create a conducive atmosphere for learning.

While online classes offer flexibility and convenience, face-to-face classes provide unique benefits that cannot be fully replicated in a virtual environment. By combining the strengths of both approaches, educators can create dynamic learning experiences that cater to the diverse needs of students.
