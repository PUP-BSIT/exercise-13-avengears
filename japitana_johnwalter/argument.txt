Students are advised to take part in online classes in case of bad weather, scheduling issues, or other unexpected causes leading to cancellations of face-to-face classes. Students may finish their education at home in comfort and safety with the help of online classes. It keeps the pupils safe from outside threats, but it also keeps them from learning as much as they could. Although a student's home may shield them from potentially harmful outdoors, internal factors can easily divert a child's attention from their studies. Student distractions from the lesson at hand include using their devices needlessly, inadvertently leaving the classroom, and other behaviors.

Online learning lacks the supervised interactions and relationship-building that face-to-face (F2F) classes provide between students and teachers. F2F offers a space for in-the-moment conversations, interactive learning, and immediate feedback, an all-essential element of a well-rounded educational experience. Additionally, face-to-face interactions with teachers and peers develop transparency and discipline in students. Face-to-face instruction also instills a sense of responsibility and dedication to academic goals. It guarantees constant engagement and growth, which is particularly beneficial when the class encounters difficult technical issues and practical uses.
